<h2> Name: Elizabeth Carré </h2>
<h3>Where you grew up:  </h3>
<p>
 I grew in Middletown, CT a small city about a 20 - 25 min drive south of Hartford, CT. 
If you have ever watched a Michel bays movie or Hamiliton the  musical, you have encountered 
a student of Wesleyan University, which resides in my hometown.

<h3>My Major... </h3>
<p>Ihave previously Majored in Studio Art and Linguistic with multiple minors, from SUNY Stony Brook.
I have my Master in Fine Arts focusing on Design, sculpture and UX design Principles, from Mass Art. 
My current epistemological endeavors is Cyber security, clothing design, and UX/UI design.  
However i would still like to return to cognitive and computation linguistics, focusing on 
language acquisition and decoding variations.

 <h3> Web development background...</h3>
<p> I use to teach intro to web design and intro to Java Script. I have used 
    Arduino and Processing in the past for my artwork. I am good at reading
    Java script and understanding what the code is trying to do, however
    I rarely get to utilize my skills at work outside of CSS and HTML and so 
    my JavaScript skills are a bit rusty. I am excited to get back into coding
    and learning new skills.

<h3>  Software development background </h3>
<p> I have worked with Arduino and processing for art projects in the past. 
    I have also worked with Unity and C# for VR art installations. As well as several
    other projection mapping tools.
    I have a basic understanding of fabrication software like rhino and egal. 
    I have used it in some of my projects.
    I am excited to learn more about software development and how to apply it
    to my art practice. Additionally I am familiar with the creative suite of 
    adobe, affinity, Autodesk and other design software.
